# Slide 1: Reactive Extensions for JavaScript
## Commentary:
Hello and welcome to the presentation on RxJS. Today, we'll be diving into the world of
Reactive Extensions for JavaScript, also known as RxJS. Let's explore what it's all about.

# Slide 2: Introduction

Brief overview of the topic: What is RxJS?
Purpose: Why is RxJS important?

## Commentary:
- RxJS stands for Reactive Extensions for JavaScript.
- It's a library for reactive programming using Observables to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based
code.
- RxJS was developed by Microsoft in collaboration with a community of Open Source developers
- and is now widely used in the JavaScript community.
- This is important because it helps us manage complex asynchronous flows more easily.

# Slide 3: Key Concepts

- Observable: What is an Observable?
- Observer: What is an Observer?
- Subscription: How does Subscription work?

## Commentary:
- Let's start by understanding some key concepts in RxJS.
- An Observable is like a data stream that we can subscribe to.
- An Observer is what listens to these streams.
- A Subscription is the connection between the Observable and the Observer

# Slide 4: Examples of Usage

- Simple examples: Creating an Observable and subscribing to it.
- Asynchronous operations: How RxJS simplifies working with asynchronous operations?

## Commentary:
- Now, let's see a simple example of Observable.
- We'll start with simple examples of creating an Observable and subscribing to it.

# Slide 5: Hot and Cold Observables

## Commentary:
- Cold Observables start emitting values when they are subscribed to.
- Hot Observables start emitting values when they are created, regardless of whether there are any subscribers.

# Slide 6: Subject and BehaviorSubject

## Commentary:
- Subjects are like an Observable, but can multicast to many Observers.

### Subject:
- Acts as both an Observable and an Observer.
- Can multicast values to multiple subscribers.
- Useful for broadcasting messages to multiple subscribers, similar to the Observer pattern.

### BehaviorSubject:
- Also acts as both an Observable and an Observer.
- Holds onto the latest emitted value.
- Subscribers immediately receive the latest value upon subscription, or an initial value if none has been emitted.

### Unsubscribe
- Proper memory management is crucial to prevent memory leaks.
- Resource cleanup is done using the unsubscribe() method when unsubscribing from the Observable.

# Slide 7: Operators

## Commentary:
- Operators are functions that build on the observables foundation to enable sophisticated manipulation of collections.
- Let me introduce you to some of the most commonly used operators

- Combination operators allow you to combine multiple Observables into a single Observable.

# Slide 8: Practical Example in Real Life
- Search for a user in GitHub

## Commentary:
Now, let's explore a real-life example of RxJS.
We'll look at how we can use RxJS to search for a user on GitHub.

# Slide 9: Conclusion

Recap: Main ideas and advantages of RxJS.
Resources for further learning: Links to documentation, guides, and code examples.
## Commentary:
To wrap things up, let's recap what we've learned today about RxJS.
We've covered the key concepts, seen examples of
its usage, and explored its real-life applications.
If you're interested in learning more, I've included some resources
for further reading and exploration. Thank you for your attention!
